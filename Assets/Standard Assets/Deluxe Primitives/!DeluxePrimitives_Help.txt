0. Summary
__________

Deluxe Primitives is a massive pack of very basic models, designed for use in game development.

You can use them as a comprehensive prototyping model library or use them as a basis for a minimalistic retro artstyle aesthetic. The models are designed to be flexible by being scalable and combinable, allowing for high versatility in their uses.

There are all kind of shapes; spheres, cubes, planes, frames, hills, pits, curves, ramps, rings, containers, and others, totalling around 160 individual models.

Every model has been tested in the Unity3D engine, fully ready for use right away. Normals, triangulation, UVs, scale and pivots are all taken into account and checked. You will find the models in this pack follow a clear and consistent standard with this.




1. Naming system
________________

To help find the right model you need quickly, this package uses a clear naming system.
Here are the explanations:

_doublesided 	=	The model has normals pointed in both directions, meaning its visible both inside and outside.

_external		=	Normals point outside only, meaning the model is only visible on the outside.

_internal		=	Normals point inside only, so the model is only visible on the inside.

_5sided			=	Sided means how many sides does the model of that variation have. mesh_Cone_5sided has 5 sides.

_onesided		=	The model only has one side. Commonly seen on flat primitives like the circle, triangle and square planes.

_MirroredUVs	=	Only seen on some spheres. This means that the texture will be mirrored at the half of a sphere, instead of having a fully unique surface.

_cubemapped		=	Also a thing only on a few spheres. It means that the sphere was modeled out of a cube. Search "cube mapped sphere" for more information.


File formats
.OBJ			=	These are game-ready exported models you can import to Unity3D or other game engine that supports this format.
.BLEND			=	The original Blender source files of the models. If you need to re-export them in a different format or tweak them, you can use these to do so. They're located in the Source folder.


The lonely material file in the "Materials" folder is a default grey material that is applied to the models. This file is automatically generated for you if you import any .OBJ model into Unity3D.



2. Tips & tricks
________________

-Creative thinking is key when using this pack. With the 160 models, you can scale them, combine them and apply seamless surface textures to create easy props for your game.

-Stretch cubes to make rectangles, make frames taller to turn them into tubes, squish spheres into ovals and extend cones into tall spikes. Re-use and combine for endless possibilities!

-The package was initially inspired by the old Nintendo64 era graphics, which were very clear in their function and simple to make, but were still charming to look at and play with.

-I recommend trying out low-resolution seamless textures on these models, in the style of 32x32 or 64x64 pixels. The result is like combining crisp pixel art with simplistic models for a very cute aesthetic.

-The "Source" folder contains the original .blend source files for each model if you happen to need them ever. The .obj format models are game-engine ready with the correct export setting from blender, so use them.

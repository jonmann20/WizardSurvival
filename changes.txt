-    This file defines some of the browsers that Microsoft's implementation provides in
-    <windir>\Microsoft.NET\Framework\<ver>\CONFIG\Browsers\*.browser
-	
-	It is not derived from any file distributed with Microsoft's implementation.  Since
-	we can't distribute MS's browser files, we use browscap.ini to determine 
-	browser capabilities.  Then, if and only if the application contains App_Browser/*.browser
-	files and we are using .NET 2.0 or higher, we supplement the capabilities with the 
-	information in those files and the files in this directory.  The primary goal of this file
-	is provide browser definitions that might be referenced in App_Browser/*.browser files.

+    This file defines some of the browsers that Microsoft's implementation provides in
+    <windir>\Microsoft.NET\Framework\<ver>\CONFIG\Browsers\*.browser
+	
+	It is not derived from any file distributed with Microsoft's implementation.  Since
+	we can't distribute MS's browser files, we use browscap.ini to determine 
+	browser capabilities.  Then, if and only if the application contains App_Browser/*.browser
+	files and we are using .NET 2.0 or higher, we supplement the capabilities with the 
+	information in those files and the files in this directory.  The primary goal of this file
+	is provide browser definitions that might be referenced in App_Browser/*.browser files.
